\begin{abstract}
Neural networks are increasingly used in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),
where safety is paramount. Considering this, there are many recent
efforts on combining formal methods with neural networks. However,
none of the developed formal techniques are capable of verifying
timing requirements, which is essential for safe operation of CPS.

In this paper we make two novel contributions towards the design of a
new class of neural networks for safety called \acp{ENN}. First,
we provide a synchronous execution semantics of neural networks and
extend them with an unique run-time enforcement
framework to facilitate the mitigation of safety issues at
run-time. Second, we propose an enforcement algorithm that can
enforce policies that constrain neural networks by ensuring that all valued input and output remain policy
compliant and the response time of the network also remains policy
compliant. Thus, \acp{ENN} provide the first formal framework for
creating real-time systems based on neural networks.
Through two complex examples of safety-critical applications, we
demonstrate that the developed approach enhances the safety and quality
of the benchmarks. This paper paves the way towards the design of safer
neural networks using run-time enforcement.
