  Abstract                 = {We propose a new language called Precision Timed C (PRET-C), for predictable and lightweight multi-threading in C. PRET-C supports synchronous concurrency, preemption, and a high-level construct for logical time. In contrast to existing synchronous languages, PRET-C offers C-based shared memory communications between concurrent threads that is guaranteed to be thread safe. Due to the proposed synchronous semantics, the mapping of logical time to physical time can be achieved much more easily than with plain C, thanks to a Worst Case Reaction Time (WCRT) analyzer (not presented here). Associated to the PRET-C programming language, we present a dedicated target architecture, called ARPRET, which combines a hardware accelerator associated to an existing softcore processor. This allows us to improve the throughput while preserving the predictability. With extensive benchmarking, we then demonstrate that ARPRET not only achieves completely predictable execution of PRET-C programs, but also improves the throughput when compared to the pure software execution of PRET-C. The PRET-C software approach is also significantly more efficient in comparison to two other light-weight concurrent C variants (namely SC and Protothreads), as well as the well-known Esterel synchronous programming language.},

The synchronous approach is then introduced informally and its possible impact on the design of real-time and reactive systems is discussed. The authors present and discuss the application fields and the principles of synchronous programming. The major concern of the synchronous approach is to base synchronous programming languages on mathematical models. This makes it possible to handle compilation, logical correctness proofs, and verification of real-time programs in a formal way, leading to a clean and precise methodology for design and programming.<<ETX>>},

  Abstract                 = {One of the key factors which limits the use of neural networks in many industrial applications has been the difficulty of demonstrating that a trained network will continue to generate reliable outputs once it is in routine use. An important potential source of errors is novel input data; that is, input data which differ significantly from the data used to train the network. The author investigates the relationship between the degree of novelty of input data and the corresponding reliability of the outputs from the network. He describes a quantitative procedure for assessing novelty, and demonstrates its performance by using an application which involves monitoring oil flow in multiphase pipelines.<<ETX>>},

Formal verification is a powerful technique used to mathematically prove that an appropriately scaled model of a system does or does not exhibit desirable properties. This paper discusses how formal verification has been used to evaluate HAI. It has been used to evaluate human-automation interfaces for usability properties and to find potential mode confusion. It has also been used to evaluate system safety properties in light of formally modeled task analytic human behavior. While capable of providing insights into problems associated with HAI, formal verification does not scale as well as other techniques such as simulation. However, advances in formal verification continue to address this problem, and approaches that allow it to complement more traditional analysis methods can potentially avoid this limitation.},

A fuzzy rule based neural network is constructed to obtain driver individual driving rules from their vehicle trajectory data. A machine learning method reinforcement learning is used to train the neural network such that the neural network can mimic driving behavior of individual drivers. Vehicle actions by neural network are compared to actions from naturalistic data. Furthermore, this paper applies the proposed method to analyze the heterogeneities of driving behavior from different drivers’ data. Driving data in the two driving situations are extracted from Naturalistic Truck Driving Study and Naturalistic Car Driving Study databases provided by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute according to pre-defined criteria. Driving actions were recorded in instrumented vehicles that have been equipped with specialized sensing, processing, and recording equipment.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an applicative language, SIGNAL, designed to program real-time systems. The language is based on a synchronous notion of time. We assume the execution of operations to have a zero logical time duration; then, the sequence of communication events determines entirely a temporal reference. The ordering of the runable operations is limited only by the dependencies between the calculi : this is the point of view of data flow languages. SIGNAL is a data flow language (where the potential parallelism is implicit), which permits a structural description of interconnected processes. SIGNAL handles possibly infinite sequences of values (called signals) characterized by an implicit clock which specifies the relative instants (with respect to other signals) at which these values are available. Specific operators, such as delay, undersampling, deterministic merge, are designed to express temporal relations between different signals : in this way, a SIGNAL program expresses both functional and temporal relationships between all the involved signals. The language is semantically sound, and its declarative style allows to derive, by a simple projection on the commutative field Z/3Z, a complete static calculus of the timing of any SIGNAL process, called its clock calculus. Hence, the language SIGNAL is also a formal system to reason about timing and concurrency. The clock calculus is completed together with the dependency analysis of a given program. This leads to a conditional dependence graph in which the edges may be labelled by the involved clocks. From this graph, we generate code for a sequential machine, but it appears to be the suitable level to study the implementation on a multiprocessor architecture.},

  Abstract                 = {We present AI2, the first sound and scalable analyzer for deep neural networks. Based on overapproximation, AI2can automatically prove safety properties (e.g., robustness) of realistic neural networks (e.g., convolutional neural networks). The key insight behind AI2is to phrase reasoning about safety and robustness of neural networks in terms of classic abstract interpretation, enabling us to leverage decades of advances in that area. Concretely, we introduce abstract transformers that capture the behavior of fully connected and convolutional neural network layers with rectified linear unit activations (ReLU), as well as max pooling layers. This allows us to handle real-world neural networks, which are often built out of those types of layers. We present a complete implementation of AI2together with an extensive evaluation on 20 neural networks. Our results demonstrate that: (i) AI2is precise enough to prove useful specifications (e.g., robustness), (ii) AI2can be used to certify the effectiveness of state-of-the-art defenses for neural networks, (iii) AI2is significantly faster than existing analyzers based on symbolic analysis, which often take hours to verify simple fully connected networks, and (iv) AI2can handle deep convolutional networks, which are beyond the reach of existing methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Deep neural networks have achieved impressive experimental results in image classification, but can surprisingly be unstable with respect to adversarial perturbations, that is, minimal changes to the input image that cause the network to misclassify it. With potential applications including perception modules and end-to-end controllers for self-driving cars, this raises concerns about their safety. We develop a novel automated verification framework for feed-forward multi-layer neural networks based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). We focus on safety of image classification decisions with respect to image manipulations, such as scratches or changes to camera angle or lighting conditions that would result in the same class being assigned by a human, and define safety for an individual decision in terms of invariance of the classification within a small neighbourhood of the original image. We enable exhaustive search of the region by employing discretisation, and propagate the analysis layer by layer. Our method works directly with the network code and, in contrast to existing methods, can guarantee that adversarial examples, if they exist, are found for the given region and family of manipulations. If found, adversarial examples can be shown to human testers and/or used to fine-tune the network. We implement the techniques using Z3 and evaluate them on state-of-the-art networks, including regularised and deep learning networks. We also compare against existing techniques to search for adversarial examples and estimate network robustness.},

However, a major obstacle in applying them to safety-critical systems is the great difficulty in providing formal guarantees about their behavior. We present a novel, scalable, and efficient technique for verifying properties of deep neural networks (or providing counter-examples). The technique is based on the simplex method, extended to handle the non-convex Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which is a crucial ingredient in many modern neural networks. The verification procedure tackles neural networks as a whole, without making any simplifying assumptions. We evaluated our technique on a prototype deep neural network implementation of the next-generation airborne collision avoidance system for unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu). Results show that our technique can successfully prove properties of networks that are an order of magnitude larger than the largest networks verified using existing methods.},

Such systems typically consist of embedded computers that interact closely with physical processes within a feedback loop.

A program's worst-case reaction time (WCRT) to inputs is usually used to ensure that timing constraints are met. Unfortunately, the standard has no provisions for specifying real-time constraints. Moreover, typical implementations of IEC 61499 are tightly coupled to their runtime environments-each with possibly different semantics and temporal properties-which makes it difficult to automate the estimation of their WCRTs. We propose to adopt a synchronous model for IEC 61499 programs. This allows the programs to be executed without the need of a run-time environment. Consequently, we are able to use a novel model-checking technique to estimate the WCRT of IEC 61499 programs. Experimental results on a suite of programs show that this approach provides conservative estimates that are, on average, less than 10 percent off from the actual WCRT.},

However, many of these approaches provide inadequate forms of safety assurance required for certification. As a result, neural networks are typically restricted to advisory roles in safety-related applications. Neural networks have the ability to operate in unpredictable and changing environments. It is therefore desirable to certify them for highly-dependable roles in safety critical systems. This paper outlines the safety criteria which are safety requirements for the behaviour of neural networks. If enforced, the criteria can contribute to justifying the safety of ANN functional properties. Characteristics of potential neural network models are also outlined and are based upon representing knowledge in interpretable and understandable forms. The paper also presents a safety lifecycle for artificial neural networks. This lifecycle focuses on managing behaviour represented by neural networks and contributes to providing acceptable forms of safety assurance.},

  Abstract                 = {`Safety Critical Artificial Neural Networks' (SCANNs) have been previously defined to perform nonlinear function approximation and learning. SCANN exploits safety constraints to ensure identified failure modes are mitigated for highly-dependable roles. It represents both qualitative and quantitative knowledge using fuzzy rules and is described as a `hybrid' neural network. The `Safety Lifecycle for Artificial Neural Networks' (SLANN) has also previously defined the appropriate development and safety analysis tasks for these `hybrid' neural networks. This paper examines the practicalities of using the SCANN and SLANN for Gas Turbine Aero-Engine control. The solution facilitates adaptation to a changing environment such as engine degradation and offers extra cost efficiency over conventional approaches. A walkthrough of the SLANN is presented demonstrating the interrelationship of development and safety processes enabling product-based safety arguments. Results illustrating the benefits and safety of the SCANN in a Gas Turbine Engine Model are provided using the SCANN simulation tool.},

Our program monitors, called edit automata, are abstract machines that examine the sequence of application program actions and transform the sequence when it deviates from a specified policy. Edit automata have a rich set of transformational powers: they may terminate an application, thereby truncating the program action stream; they may suppress undesired or dangerous actions without necessarily terminating the program; and they may also insert additional actions into the event stream.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a theory of runtime enforcement based on mechanism models called MRAs (Mandatory Results Automata). MRAs can monitor and transform security-relevant actions and their results. Because previous work could not model monitors transforming results, MRAs capture realistic behaviors outside the scope of previous models. MRAs also have a simple but realistic operational semantics that makes it straightforward to define concrete MRAs. Moreover, the definitions of policies and enforcement with MRAs are significantly simpler and more expressive than those of previous models. Putting all these features together, we argue that MRAs make good general models of runtime mechanisms, upon which a theory of runtime enforcement can be based. We develop some enforceability theory by characterizing the policies MRAs can and cannot enforce.},

The key property is the preservation of non-determinism, allowing us to reason on (and verify) timing properties at the model level without assuming any specific scheduling policy or stipulating specific order of execution for the deployment. This provides for a clear separation of concerns, where the designer can focus on properties of the application prior to, and separately from, deployment verification. The proposed timing semantics is backwards compatible to the current standard, thus allow for reuse of existing designs. The transitional property allows timing requirements to propagate to downstream sub-systems, and can be utilized for scheduling both at device and network level. Based on a translation to RTFM-tasks and resources, IEC 61499 models can be analyzed, compiled and executed.

WCET tools designed for application program analysis have been applied to analyze RTOS routines by several research groups, but poor WCET estimations have been reported. Timing analysis of real-time systems considering both applications and RTOS has not been fully studied. So we intend to give a survey of related work on WCET analysis of RTOS.

In particular it is shown that networks of spiking neurons are, with regard to the number of neurons that are needed, computationally more powerful than these other neural network models. A concrete biologically relevant function is exhibited which can be computed by a single spiking neuron (for biologically reasonable values of its parameters), but which requires hundreds of hidden units on a sigmoidal neural net. On the other hand, it is known that any function that can be computed by a small sigmoidal neural net can also be computed by a small network of spiking neurons. This article does not assume prior knowledge about spiking neurons, and it contains an extensive list of references to the currently available literature on computations in networks of spiking neurons and relevant results from neurobiology.},

  Abstract                 = {This study presents the applicability of an ensemble of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and learning paradigms for weather forecasting in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. The proposed ensemble method for weather forecasting has advantages over other techniques like linear combination. Generally, the output of an ensemble is a weighted sum, which are weight-fixed, with the weights being determined from the training or validation data. In the proposed approach, weights are determined dynamically from the respective certainties of the network outputs. The more certain a network seems to be of its decision, the higher the weight. The proposed ensemble model performance is contrasted with multi-layered perceptron network (MLPN), Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN), radial basis function network (RBFN), Hopfield model (HFM) predictive models and regression techniques. The data of temperature, wind speed and relative humidity are used to train and test the different models. With each model, 24-h-ahead forecasts are made for the winter, spring, summer and fall seasons. Moreover, the performance and reliability of the seven models are then evaluated by a number of statistical measures. Among the direct approaches employed, empirical results indicate that HFM is relatively less accurate and RBFN is relatively more reliable for the weather forecasting problem. In comparison, the ensemble of neural networks produced the most accurate forecasts.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a lack of trusted techniques which will allow ANNs to be used in safety critical systems. There is a lack of rigid specification methods for ANNs. By “rigid” we mean “not open to misinterpretation”. Research in formal methods is currently very fashionable. Informal methods are well established in industry. However, no similar methods exist for neural networks. It is tempting to believe that, should a rigid specification method be devised for neural networks, that proving conformance to the specification should be relatively easy when compared with software systems. The justification for this is based in the simplicity of the ANN compared to software, and the availability of appropriate statistical methods. Hierarchical methods for the design of ANNs are not sufficiently advanced. These are highly useful in conventional systems because they allow an initially highly complex design to be partitioned into components. Although an embedded ANN may be considered as a component it is difficult to decompose it into useful subcomponents. Therefore it may remain highly complex and difficult to analyse. The nature of problem domains in which neural networks are applied tend to have ill-defined solutions with respect to formal descriptive techniques, and hence existing verification methods are unlikely to be successful. Instead, more complete methods of testing may be required. Reliability can be attained via standard methods where an ANN is emulated. Additional protection at the computational level is also possible given suitable ANN architectures, hardware and training techniques.},

In recently years, neural networks have displayed good performance in solving a diverse number of problems. Unfortunately, artificial neural networks are not immune to this misfortune presented by missing values. Furthermore, in most real word settings, it is often the case that, the only data available for the training of artificial neural networks consists of a significant amount of missing values. In such cases, we are left with little choice but to use this data for the purposes of training neural networks, although doing so may result in a poorly performing neural network. In this paper, we describe the use of neural network dropout as a technique for training neural networks in the presence of missing values. We test the performance of different neural network architectures on different levels of artificial generated missing values introduces on the MNIST handwriting recognition dataset, Cifar-10 and the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and find that in most cases it results in significantly better performance of the neural network compared to other missing data handling techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Verifying that the behavior of an autonomous systems is safe is fundamental for safety-critical properties like preventing crashes in autonomous vehicles. Unfortunately, exhaustive verification techniques fail to scale to the size of real-life systems. Moreover, these systems frequently use algorithms whose runtime behavior cannot be determined at design time (e.g., machine learning algorithms). This presents another problem given that these algorithms cannot be verified at design time. Fortunately, a technique known as runtime assurance can be used for these cases. The strategy that runtime assurance uses to verify a system is to add small components (known as enforcers) to the system that monitor its output and evaluate whether the output is safe or not. If the output is safe, then the enforcer lets it pass; if the output is unsafe, the enforcer replaces it with a safe output. For instance, in a drone system that must be restricted to fly within a constrained area (a.k.a. geo-fence) an enforcer can be used to monitor the movement commands to the drone. Then, if a movement command keeps the drone within the geo-fence, the enforcer lets it pass, but if the command takes the drone outside of this area, the enforcer replaces it with a safe command (e.g., hovering). Given that enforcers are small components fully specified at design time, it is possible to use exhaustive verification techniques to prove that they can keep the behavior of the whole system safe (e.g., the drone flying within the geo-fence) even if the system contains unverified code.},

In this paper, we extend the model to multiple autonomous systems, and describe the advantages of applying model checking and difficulties. The targeted line tracing robot usually has only one or two sensors to detect a line painted on white background, and it traces the line according to the read value of the sensors. It is easy to trace if the line is simple straight line. However, lines sometimes become complicated by existence of random sequential corners. Those robots are often used in robot competitions for university students in Japan. Driving time, accuracy and robustness are evaluated in such competitions. The robot is usually designed as a stand-alone. Here, we extend such line tracing robots to multiple autonomous robots by adding communication functions and proximity sensors. We consider multiple lines to be crossed where robots might hit each other. Although the introduced model is simple, it has enough power to provide a structure where we can discuss safety and robustness using model checking. Our proposed method can also treat time constraints of robot controls.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper the more advanced, in comparison with traditional machine learning approaches, deep learning methods are explored with the purpose of accurately predicting the aggregated energy consumption. Despite the fact that a wide range of machine learning methods have been applied to probabilistic energy prediction, the deep learning ones certainly represent the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods with remarkable success in a spectrum of practical applications. In particular, the use of Multi Layer Perceptrons, recently enhanced with deep learning capabilities, is proposed. Furthermore, its performance is compared with the most commonly used machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Processes, Regression Trees, Ensemble Boosting and Linear Regression. The analysis of the day-ahead energy prediction demonstrates that different prediction methods present significantly different levels of accuracy in the case of a challenging dataset that comprises an interesting mix of consumers, wind and solar generation. The results show that Multi Layer Perceptrons outperform all the eight methods used as a benchmark in this study.},

  Abstract                 = {Using artificial neural networks (ANNs) in critical applications can be challenging due to the often experimental nature of ANN construction and the “black box” label that is frequently attached to ANNs. Well-accepted process models exist for algorithmic software development which facilitate software validation and acceptance. The software development process model presented herein is targeted specifically toward ANNs in critical applications. This model is not unwieldy, and could easily be used on projects without critical aspects. This should be of particular interest to organizations that use ANNs and need to maintain or achieve a capability maturity model or ISO software development rating. Further, while this model is aimed directly at neural network development, with minor modifications, the model could be applied to any technique wherein knowledge is extracted from existing data, such as other numeric approaches or knowledge-based systems},

  Abstract                 = {Artificial neural networks are an alternative computational paradigm with roots in neurobiology which has attracted increasing interest in recent years. This book is a comprehensive introduction to the topic that stresses the systematic development of the underlying theory. Starting from simple threshold elements, more advanced topics are introduced, such as multilayer networks, efficient learning methods, recurrent networks, and self-organization. The various branches of neural network theory are interrelated closely and quite often unexpectedly, so the chapters treat the underlying connection between neural models and offer a unified view of the current state of research in the field. The book has been written for anyone interested in understanding artificial neural networks or in learning more about them. The only mathematical tools needed are those learned during the first two years at university. The text contains more than 300 figures to stimulate the intuition of the reader and to illustrate the kinds of computation performed by neural networks. Material from the book has been used successfully for courses in Germany, Austria and the United States.},

  Abstract                 = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as autonomous vehicles or smart power grids, use interactive machine learning modules for decision making. Current design approaches use multiple machine learning modules, often using neural networks, to achieve the desired functionality. Timing validation is performed using measurement-based approaches, which may produce unsound results. To this end, we propose a new approach for designing such systems, by relying on the well known synchronous paradigm. Using this approach, we introduce Synchronous Artificial Neural Networks (SANNs), where we associate logical time to the different operations of the network. This approach provides sound compositional primitives, which enable the composition of interacting neural networks to ensure causality and determinism. We then show that we can embed the generated code on time predictable platforms enabling static analysis. Overall, this paper develops synchronous neural networks implemented in Esterel for the design of time predictable systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by developing a time predictable implementation of several applications, ranging from 5-100+ neurons, realised using the T-CREST platform. We also implemented a complex Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) application comprising of 1000+ neurons and 16 different layers using Esterel for a soft real-time application. Overall, the developed methodology opens new avenues of research in the direction of time predictable neural networks.},

Standard multi-core processors are optimized for the average case and are hardly analyzable. Within the T-CREST project we propose novel solutions for time-predictable multi-core architectures that are optimized for the \{WCET\} instead of the average-case execution time. The resulting time-predictable resources (processors, interconnect, memory arbiter, and memory controller) and tools (compiler, \{WCET\} analysis) are designed to ease \{WCET\} analysis and to optimize \{WCET\} performance. Compared to other processors the \{WCET\} performance is outstanding. The T-CREST platform is evaluated with two industrial use cases. An application from the avionic domain demonstrates that tasks executing on different cores do not interfere with respect to their WCET.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Real-time systems need time-predictable platforms to allow static analysis of the worst-case execution time (WCET). Standard multi-core processors are optimized for the average case and are hardly analyzable. Within the T-CREST project we propose novel solutions for time-predictable multi-core architectures that are optimized for the \{WCET\} instead of the average-case execution time. The resulting time-predictable resources (processors, interconnect, memory arbiter, and memory controller) and tools (compiler, \{WCET\} analysis) are designed to ease \{WCET\} analysis and to optimize \{WCET\} performance. Compared to other processors the \{WCET\} performance is outstanding. The T-CREST platform is evaluated with two industrial use cases. An application from the avionic domain demonstrates that tasks executing on different cores do not interfere with respect to their WCET. A signal processing application from the railway domain shows that the \{WCET\} can be reduced for computation-intensive tasks when distributing the tasks on several cores and using the network-on-chip for communication.

  Abstract                 = {Neural networks are the topic of this paper. Neural networks are very powerful as nonlinear signal processors, but obtained results are often far from satisfactory. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the reasons for these frustrations and show how to make these neural networks successful. The following are the main challenges of neural network applications: (1) Which neural network architectures should be used? (2) How large should a neural network be? (3) Which learning algorithms are most suitable? The multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture is unfortunately the preferred neural network topology of most researchers. It is the oldest neural network architecture, and it is compatible with all training softwares. However, the MLP topology is less powerful than other topologies such as bridged multilayer perceptron (BMLP), where connections across layers are allowed. The error-back propagation (EBP) algorithm is the most popular learning algorithm, but it is very slow and seldom gives adequate results. The EBP training process requires 100-1,000 times more iterations than the more advanced algorithms such as Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) or neuron by neuron (NBN) algorithms. What is most important is that the EBP algorithm is not only slow but often it is not able to find solutions for close-to-optimum neural networks. The paper describes and compares several learning algorithms.},

In order to reduce the false-positive rate and the object occlusion problem, which usually happened in camera-based pedestrian detection, we use 3D point cloud returning from Lidar depth sensor to do the further examination on the object's shape. The proposed Lidar/camera sensor fusion design complements the advantage and disadvantage of two sensors such that it is more stable in detection than others. The region proposal is given from both sensors, and candidate from two sensors are also going to the second classification for double checking. It maximums the detection rate and achieves average 99.16% detection accuracy for pedestrian detection.},

  Abstract                 = {Multicore processors provide better power-performance trade-offs compared to single-core processors. Consequently, they are rapidly penetrating market segments which are both safety critical and hard real-time in nature. However, designing time-predictable embedded applications over multicores remains a considerable challenge. This paper proposes the ForeC language for the deterministic parallel programming of embedded applications on multicores. ForeC extends C with a minimal set of constructs adopted from synchronous languages. To guarantee the worst-case performance of ForeC programs, we offer a very precise reachability-based timing analyzer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the efficient and deterministic parallel programming of multicores using a synchronous C-variant. Experimentation with large multicore programs revealed an average over-estimation of only 2% for the computed worst-case execution times (WCETs). By reducing our representation of the program's state-space, we reduced the analysis time for the largest program (with 43, 695 reachable states) by a factor of 342, to only 7 seconds.},

  Abstract                 = {Multicore processors provide better power-performance trade-offs compared to single-core processors. Consequently, they are rapidly penetrating market segments which are both safety critical and hard real-time in nature. However, designing time-predictable embedded applications over multicores remains a considerable challenge. This paper proposes the ForeC language for the deterministic parallel programming of embedded applications on multicores. ForeC extends C with a minimal set of constructs adopted from synchronous languages. To guarantee the worst-case performance of ForeC programs, we offer a very precise reachability-based timing analyzer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the efficient and deterministic parallel programming of multicores using a synchronous C-variant. Experimentation with large multicore programs revealed an average over-estimation of only 2% for the computed worst-case execution times (WCETs). By reducing our representation of the program's state-space, we reduced the analysis time for the largest program (with 43, 695 reachable states) by a factor of 342, to only 7 seconds.},

Since its publication in 2005, several run-time environments have been developed as plausible implementations. Most of them, however, are poorly suited for use in safety-critical systems, as they are unable to guarantee deterministic behaviour and predictable timing. The use of different run-time environments results in subtle behavioural differences and complicates the effort of static timing analysis. We offer an alternative solution by leveraging the model-based approach to automatically synthesize multirate synchronous programs for a multitasking environment. Our approach preserves the well-known deterministic property of synchronous programs, while facilitating static timing analysis of IEC 61499 specifications. We achieve this without the need to introduce any foreign artefact to the standard. The schedulability criterion for tasks derived using our technique is given for the rate-monotonic scheduling policy. The viability of our approach is demonstrated through a code generator, which synthesizes multirate synchronous code for multi-task execution on the muC/OS-II real-time operating system.},

  Abstract                 = {Esterel programs have traditionally been compiled to software code for general purpose processors or to hardware netlists. This paper, instead, proposes a reactive processor for the direct execution of Esterel. This intermediate approach offers the same flexibility as software compilation, while at the same time, providing much better code size and execution time. The proposed architecture, called STARPro, is a pipelined, multithreaded, reactive processor that provides native support for the direct execution of Esterel. \{STARPro\} manages Esterel threads and their scheduling, and also features a hardware preemption unit to assist the handling of the abort constructs in Esterel. In addition to the proposed architecture, we have also developed a new intermediate format called \{UCCFGsd\} (unrolled concurrent control-flow graph with surface and depth) to represent the structure of an Esterel program in our compiler. \{UCCFGsd\} closely resembles the Esterel source, and it has also been designed with Esterel hardware support in mind, allowing a straight forward translation into \{STARPro\} assembly instructions. We have compared the performance of \{STARPro\} against a recent reactive architecture and found an average of 37% speed-up in worst-case reaction times, and 38% in average-case reaction times. },

  Abstract                 = {An important issue in the design and implementation of neural networks is the sensitivity of neural network output to parameter perturbations. Past research in this area has focused on network sensitivity analysis after training. Very few research projects have considered sensitivity analysis as a design issue prior to network implementation. The authors discuss the sensitivity of the most popular and general feedforward networks (multilayer perceptron (MLP)) to its input perturbation. The sensitivity is defined as the mathematical expectation of output errors of the MLP arising from input error with respect to all input and weight values in a given continuous interval. The sensitivity for a single neuron is discussed first, and an analytical expression that is a function of the input error is approximately derived. Then an algorithm is given to compute the sensitivity for an entire MLP network. The theoretical results of the derived formula were shown to agree with experimental results. By analyzing the derived analytical expression and implementing the given algorithm on a number of representative MLP networks, some significant observations on the behavior of sensitivity are discovered, which could be useful for network design consideration.},
