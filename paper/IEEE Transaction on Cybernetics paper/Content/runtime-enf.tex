Chapter 3 presented \acfp{SNN}, as periodic networks with their systematic composition as \acfp{MNN}, to ensure that \ac{AI} applications operate in a time predictable manner.
This chapter deals with the related issue of functional verification of \acp{ANN}.
We propose the technique of \acf{RE}~\cite{recps} along with \acp{SNN} and \acp{MNN}.
